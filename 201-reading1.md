## Duckett HTML Book

### HTML Introduction 
The Introduction for this book starts off by explaining how the book is structured. The Duckett HTML & CSS book starts off by teaching HTML. It explains how to start HTML tags, and how HTML is used to create web pages. It explains how to use the various elements to create text, lists, links, images, tables, forms, etc... It also provides a disclaimer that these chapters explaining HTML are not exciting but they are the foundation of which everything else the book covers will be built on top of. 

After HTML it covers CSS, by explaining how CSS uses rules to enable us to control the styling and layout of our web pages. It breaks each of these rules into two sections: Presentation which controls things like the color of text, the fonts, background colors, and various ways to use images. The second section explains the rules for controlling where the different elements are positioned on the screen. 

The final section of this book will go over more practical uses for some of the skills we've covered. Such as how to publish your site, Search Engine Optimization, and how to use analytics software to track who comes to your site and what they see. 

### JS Introduction 
This book is divided into two separate sections. Core Concepts, and Practical Applications. Some of the Core Concepts for JavaScript include showing us how computers create models of the world using data, and how JavaScript is used to change the contents of an HTML Page. It goes over the Document Object Model (DOM), and begins a discussion about jQuery, Ajax, and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

The second section goes over how to debug your code and deal with errors. How to create sliders, modal windows, tabbed panels, and accordion menus. How to filter and sort through data, and how to deal with form enhancements and how to validate form entries.
