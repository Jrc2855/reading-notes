# Programming with JavaScript

## Operators

### Assignment Operators
Assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of the right operand. 

### Comparison Operators
Compares the operands on both sides a returns a value dependent on whether or not the comparison is true. 

### Arithmetic operators
Takes the numerical values in both operands and returns a single numerical value. 

### Bitwise operators
Treats operands as a set of 32 binary bits, but returns JavaScript numerical values.

### Logical Operators
Used with Boolean values and return a Boolean value ie. true or false.

### String Operators 
Combines two strings into what is called a concatenation. 

### Conditional Operators
Takes three operands, and returns one of two values dependent on a condition.

### Comma Operators
Evaluates both operands and returns the value of the final operand. 

### Unary Operators
Contains only a single operand. 

### Relational Operators
Compares both operands and returns a boolean value based on if the comparison is true.

# Functions
An essential building block within JavaScript. Functions follow a set of instructions to perform a task or calculate a value. 

## Defining Functions



# Control Flow
The control flow is the order that the computer executes statements in the script. Typically code is processed from top to bottom, however this can get changed when certain structures are used, such as conditionals and loops.
