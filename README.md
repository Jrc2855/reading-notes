### A Growth Mindset means looking at new situations with the mentality of "I have the opportunity to see things changing right in front of me." Rather than seeing change as a burdensome process to keep up with. 

1.Remind yourself that you chose to be in the position you're currently in, and that at one point this was everything you wanted. 
2.Life changes for everyone, the biggest difference between people is how we perceive the change. 
3.Failure is a part of learning, just as much as success is. Enjoy the process because this will lead you to appreciate the opportunities you have.
