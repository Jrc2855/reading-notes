# Wireframe
Wireframing is the practice of building a rough draft of a project before filling it out to the exact specifications of the client, or before anything is coded in. Methods for creating a wireframe can vary from person to person. Some prefer to use a pen and paper, others prefer to make it on their computer. 

## Research
Before starting your rough draft for your project it's important to consider the trends surrounding the current environment you'll be working in. This can include specific practices, such as observing your target audience, conducting user research, observing competitors. 

## Refinement
It's important to remember the fact that simplicity is underrated, a simple design can more easily be refined into what your client may be looking for. Your frame needs to be understood quickly upon reception from the client. Have confidence in your designs, if you won't have confidence in your own work you can't expect your clients to. 

## HTML
HTML is a markup language that provides the structure to your webpage. It is made up of elements which are held within opening and closing tags, and provide instructions for the data on the webpage. 

## HTML Elements
Elements include an opening tag <> some content within the tags, and a closing tag </>. Within the brackets there are Attributes that provide extra information about that specific element. 

## Nesting Elements
A nested element, explained simply is just another element inside of an element. One important thing to remember is that just like any other element, Nested elements need to be closed out before the surrounding elements. 

## Anatomy of an HTML document
##### I wrote all of the tags without brackets  
DOCTYPE html - This element is a requirement, this tells the browser that this is an HTML document. <br>
HTML & /HTML - these tags wrap around the entire webpage to begin and end the page. <br>
HEAD & /HEAD - This element will contain all fo the metadata for the webpage, which includes CSS, character set declarations, and keywords for search engine optimization
META CHARSET="utf-8" - This is the character set which will provide any standard font characteristics. <br>
TITLE & /TITLE - This will be the title at the top of your web page, it will also appear in the search tab for your page. <br>
BODY & /BODY - This is where all of your actual content will go, and will display to your webpage. This will contain your images, videos, links, audio tracks, etc...
