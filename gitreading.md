# Intro 

## What is Git? 
Git is different from GitHub. Github is a website that we use for sharing projects with other developers. Git is a Version Control System, which is allows developers to easily revisit various versions of a file or project. Professional Developers will utilize a Distributed Version Control System, which allows several people to work on a single project. Each Developer will commit their projects up when they are finished where they will be reviewed by a lead developer, before they are pushed to the main project. 

## Git Repositories
A repository is basically an online folder where all of the files for the project are held. This also includes previous versions of the main project. <br>
If a project has already been cloned into your terminal, you do not need to clone it again. Doing so will lead to a repository within a repository. Instead you simply need to change the directory with "cd" in the terminal command line, to the repository you want to access. 

## Local Structure
Put simply the structure for your local repository will go from the Working Directory, where you will need to Add it to the Index. After it's received into the index you will need to Commit it to the head, where you can finally Push it to your remote GitHub profile, and it will no longer be stored on your local machine.
