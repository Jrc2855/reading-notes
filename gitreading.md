## What is Git? 
Git is different from GitHub. Github is a website that we use for sharing projects with other developers. Git is a Version Control System, which is allows developers to easily revisit various versions of a file or project. Professional Developers will utilize a Distributed Version Control System, which allows several people to work on a single project. Each Developer will commit their projects up when they are finished where they will be reviewed by a lead developer, before they are pushed to the main project. 

## Git Repositories
A repository is basically an online folder where all of the files for the project are held. This also includes previous versions of the main project.
