# Reading 14: What Google Learned About Teams

## Psychological Safety
Psychological Safety is about creating an environment where people can feel safe to express who they truly are. The benefits of creating this type of an environment are numerous. We had a discussion over this reading with Brook Ricio, the VP of Education with Code Fellows. 

We went over the importance of recognizing each persons contributions, and how this encourages teammates to be better listeners and promotes openness within the team. Understanding that not everyone is going to get everything perfect on their first try is important because it helps everyone focus on the successes of each individual on the team, and thereby improving the success of the team. 

Creating an environment of psychological safety helps teammates feel confident in there ability to share their ideas. Unfortunately many people are reluctant to share ideas in group settings because of the fear of being ridiculed, or rejected. But by creating this sort of open envionmental space, you can get reduce that fear and encourage everyone to contribute to an idea. Starting is always the most difficult part of any team based project. No idea was absolutely perfect from the very beginning, I would compare it to a lump of clay. Once it's been put out there it can be molded, and shaped, until the idea is brought to completion. The editing and shaping is the most important part of any idea. 

We weren't presented with the first prototype of the iPhone. The Wright brothers first prototype wasn't the one that flew, and this process of shaping, and molding is essential to the successful creation of any product or idea. But if the initial idea wasn't ever presented because the individual with that idea was too afraid of how everyone else might react, then these possibilities will fail. 

In short the biggest thing that Google learned about Teams, is to show some respect and kindness to the people on your team. No one knows who will have the next big idea for a product, or a revolutionary change to how we all live.
