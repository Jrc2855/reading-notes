# Introduction to React and Components

## Component-Based Architecture

1. What is a "component"?

- A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.
- Essentially it's similar to a Function, in that it's a reusable block of code. However the difference is that a Component is designed with the ability to be used outside of it's original system, meaning it can be exported to other files. A Function only operates within it's original file.

2. What are the characteristics of a component?

- Reusability - Components are designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However some components are made for a very specific task.

- Replaceable - Components can be easily swapped out with other components

- Not Context Specific - Components are designed to operate in different environments, such as different programs and files.

- Extensible - A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior. In other words they can be modified from other components in a file, to produce a specific result.

- Encapsulated - A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

- Independent - Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components. They can run their intended use regardless of the code surrounding it.

3. What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?

- Allows developers to create "sections" of code. The best example I can compare this to, is it seems similar to the components of building a house. Each of your major appliances within a standard american home can be utilized in different settings, and with various skill sets. "Home Appliances/ Components" can be used individually from their Initial Installation Points, and are designed to work within various systems, created by different manufacturers/ developers, and by having multiple companies designing these components, it allows for growth of the overall idea.

## Props and How to use it in React

1. What is "props" short for?

- A special keyword in react, it stands for "properties".

2. How are props used in React?

- To pass data from one component to another.

3. What is the flow of props?

- Uni-Directionally which means they only pass from parent to child. 

## Things I want to know more about

- If my comparison between Components and Housing Appliances is accurate at all? Or if their is a better comparison for a component.
