# HTML Images, CSS Color, & Text

## HTML Images

Images can be used to establish a vibe for your site. They can be applied to the background of your pages, they can be displayed throughout your site, and they can be used to display a product, or represent an idea. However there are specific rules that should be followed when selecting pictures for your site. They should be relevant to the topic, and theme of your web page. They should be instantly recognizable, and they should fit the color palette of the rest of your site. Images are display using the 'img' Element which has no closing tag, you simply need to provide the url for the image in the Element. 'img src = "images/picture.jpg"' 

It's also important to note that you should always provide a folder in your code for all of your images. This can help you stay organized when your web page grows in size and popularity.

## CSS Color & Text

Color can be applied to text, background, or to the inside of any specific Elements you provide. When choosing colors for your page there are several things to take into consideration. Some of the more important ones are the contrast between your backgrounds and your text. You want to make sure your text is fully legible on your page. There are three main ways to specify a color on your page.

* RGB Values - Control how much Red, Green, and Blue are used. For Example: '(100, 100, 100)'
* Hex Codes - Six digit codes that represent the color. For Example: '#ee3e80'
* Color Names - CSS Offers 145 Colors by name, which you can use by simply typing the name.
