# HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow

## HTML Lists

There are 3 types of lists in HTML.

* Numbered Lists - These are lists that begin with a number and move in a descending order for each entry.
* Bullet Lists - These lists are also called Unordered Lists and they begin with a bullet point for each entry.
* Definition Lists - These are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms. Similar to how I've structured my reading notes.

## CSS Boxes

CSS follows a rule that enables it to treat most HTML elements as if they live in their own box. By learning to manipulate the properties of these boxes, we can control the dimensions. Create Borders around our Boxed Elements, set margins and padding to control the space in and around our box, and show and hide our boxes.

## JS Control Flow

By following a Logic Flow Chart, we can see how our code can take more than one path, which means the Browser decides which code to run depending on the current situation. These logical branches are called conditional statements. We use many tools when creating Conditional Statments, such as Comparison Operators, Logical Operators, if...else statements, switch statements, and any of the three types of loops: For, While, and Do...While.
