# HTML Text, CSS Introduction and Basic JavaScript Instructions

## HTML Text
HTML uses Elements to provide structural and semantic meaning to text on the web page. Structural elements are used to inform the developer what type of information the code is providing. For Example a <p> tag is used to provide text in between the opening and closing tags.

Semantic Elements are used to provide extra information and further control the display of the code. For example using the <strong> element to embolden text written between the opening and closing tags. 

## CSS Introduction
CSS follows rules to provide specific styling to the webpage. Along with providing control over the styling/ appearance of your web page. It also allows the developer to control the layout of all of the elements on the page, through positional CSS.

## Basic JavaScript Instructions
Statements: A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement, and should be ended with a semicolon.

Comments: Allows the developer to write comments that won't render within the page once it's loaded by the Browser. To leave a comment in JS simply use either '/*comment*/' for a multi line comment, or '//' for a single line comment.

Variables: Declared using let, var, or const. These allow the developer to assign a specific value to a variable, which can then be called when the developer needs it.
