# HTML Tables; JS Constructor Functions

## HTML Tables

You can use Tables within your HTML page to display several different types of information, Stock Prices, Sports Scores, High Score Displays, etc... To display a Table you can use the '<table>' tag to surround all of your other tags you'll need. '<tr>' indicates the start of a row. '<td>' is used for each cell of your table. '<th>' represents the heading of a column. These elements can also be manipulated through the 'rowspan' and 'colspan' attributes, which can make the various cells of a table span more than one row or column. 

## JS Constructor Functions

Constructor functions are used to create an object. W3Schools explains that an Object can be compared to a car, or similar product because they have various properties. I see Constructors similar to factories that create these "car" objects. The Developer provides the template/Properties and the "Factory/Constructor" creates the Object. To create a new object (instance) you can use the 'new' keyword followed by the Constructor name, and the various Properties you've instilled into the Constructor.
